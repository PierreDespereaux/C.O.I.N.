# Section 1: Declaration

      1. If a work is pulled from distribution, the author has thirty (30) days to redistribute the work to a chosen medium.
      
         1. In the event the work is not redistributed with thirty (30) days, the work transitions to Open Distribution and Open Modification (see above and below).

## Limited Modification Expiration

1. If an author voluntarily retires the work, the work is converted to Open Modification and all future modifications should be incorporated into the original work when possible.

2. If the author is not active within one hundred and eighty (180) days, neither on their work's main distribution page nor via replies to any correspondence (e.g. PMs, emails, thread activity, etc), the author's work is considered retired and transitions to Open Modification.

2. Modifications that the author decides are best hosted separately as an individual work may uploaded by their original authors; not by the author of the parent work.

   1. Such works must be released under the CMA.

3. All modifications are to be detailed within a changelog, regardless of their source.

## Modifications Defined

1. Levels of modification include, but are not limited to:

   - Error Corrections - ITM and UDR removal, grammar and typo corrections, fixing errors that break the game, fixes that result in better mod compatibility, etc.

   - Compatibility Patches - patches made for compatibility between two separate works, etc.

   - Standardization - dialogue standardization (e.g. "continue" to "Continue"), naming standardization (e.g. following a naming scheme), etc.

   - Re-drafting - taking what is an early draft of a work and redrafting it to be more complete, while sticking to the original author's intent for the work.
   
      - Redrafting allows for some degree of necessary artistic and logic interpretations.
      
   - Extensions - adding new material that is consistent with the original work and artistic direction.
   
   - Multi-pathing - adding content that allows users to take alternative paths from the original work's intent. Often this relates to quest related works within games with different choices or paths added, which affects the outcome of the original work (e.g. adding different options for players who roleplay as vampires).
   
      - The original path is left intact and is not diminished in any way, but the user is given a chance to take a different path.
      
      - Multi-pathing to the degree that it perverts the intent of the original work is only allowed under Open Modification, unless the original author agrees to such.
      
   - Artistic Conflict Resolution - correcting artistic conflicts within the work itself, between sister works, or within extensions.
   
   - Artistic Destruction is only allowed under Open Modification, unless the original author agrees to such. Artistic destruction is removing any element of a work for the intent of changing the artistic direction of the original work.
   
   - Perversion is only allowed under Open Modification, unless the original author agrees to such. Perversion is modifying a work in such a way that the work's intent is perverted from it's original intent. This is essentially vandalism of a work. (e.g. altering a dialogue mod that adds "Dogs are nice"; changing it to "Dogs are stupid").
   
2. Artistic Destruction and/or Perversion via patch or alternative replacement plugin is allowed under Limited Modification, as long as the original work is left intact.

   1. If the original author is still actively supporting the original work, any patches or replacement plugins should be offered to original author for incorporation into the original work or hosted on the work's distribution medium.
     
      1. Credit is to be given to the original author of the provided patch or replacement plugins.
      
## Appendix

### Retired Works

A work can only be "retired" when released with Limited Modification status. A work is retired when the original author posts notification of their retiring the work or if the retirement conditions are met.

### Alternative Replacement Plugin

An Alternative Replacement Plugin is a plugin which replaces the original plugin (has the same name). These types of plugins usually only amend the original with additions or corrections.

2. Changelog file may be either a text document or a HTML file. HTML is the preferred medium and a template has been provided.

3. The changelog file must be a separate file provided with the work, or a separate section on distribution medium. It can not be incorporated into any other files.

4. Changes entered into the changelog must be documented such that others not familiar with the mod can easily view and understand the changes made from version to version.

# Section 7: The ReadMe File

1. CMA mods must be packaged with a ReadMe file, else instructions for the work must be provided on the distribution medium. [See example here](https://wiki.step-project.com/Project:Open_Modding_Licenses/ReadmeExample).

2. If the CMA is ever in conflict with the ZeniMax Terms of Service or the Creation Kit EULA, then those terms take precedence over the CMA in the areas of conflict.

3. Authors releasing works under the CMA may be "blacklisted" at any time if there is a breach of the these articles for the works released under the CMA.

   1. Authors will be provided a 14 day grace period to comply to any notice of a breach before the author is blacklisted.
   
      1. Official notices may only be sent by one of the authorities listed in Section 9.
      
   2. This blacklist will be a publicly provided list of author's names stating the listed author breached the agreement in some manner. There is no legalities backing this list. It's simply a "list of shame" of author who have went back on their choice to honor these articles.
