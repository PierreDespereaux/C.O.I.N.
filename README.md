I have long been a fan of mods that add new coins to the game. The fact that you can find Septims deep in Dwemer ruins or Draugr crypts that have not been touched in hundreds, if not thousands, of years has always bugged me. However, none of the current offerings gave me quite what I wanted. I have been planning this mod on-and-off for nearly a year and a half, figuring out exactly what I want to do with it and gaining the proper permissions in order to release it in a form that I would be happy with, I am really happy to see it finally released.

C.O.I.N. will add seven new types of coins to your game at varying rarities and placed in locations that are logical and make sense within the world of the Elder Scrolls. You will never find Septims on Draugr ever again!

- Seven new coins to find on your travels: Ancient Falmer Auri, Dwarven Dumacs, Atmoran Drakr, Ancient Nord Haralds, Medes, Sancar, and Ulfrics!
- Each coin is distributed in places that make sense:  
    - Ancient Falmer Auri - Forgotten Vale  
    - Atmoran Drakr - Dragon Cult ruins  
    - Dwarven Dumac - Dwarven Ruins  
    - Ancient Nord Harald - Ancient Nord Ruins  
    - Mede - Emperor's Quarters of the Katariah  
    - Sancar - Thalmor Embassy, Thalmor HQ, and Northwatch Keep  
    - Ulfric - Windhelm Blacksmith and the Palace of the Kings  
- Proper leveled list integration to ensure the coins show up in containers and on enemies in addition to being found loose in the world.

__**Coinage Value**__

I have not altered the rate or amount at which coins are dropped, but I have edited the value that each coin is worth. Upon picking up one of the new coins it will be automatically turned into the coin's value in Septims. Ancient coins will not be worth much as they are little more than trinkets to the citizens of Tamriel, however minted coinage will be worth as much, if not more, than the Imperial Septim. For example, the Dominion Sancar is more powerful than the Septim and is worth 1.25 Septims.

You can see the complete list of values below:

C.O.I.N. makes edits to several dungeons in order to distribute the new coinage. These edits are very minor and only replace the vanilla gold coins that were already there. However, due to how load order works, it is recommended you load C.O.I.N. above other mods that may also edit these cells, notably lighting overhauls like [Relighting Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/8586) and [Enhanced Lights and FX](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2424).
